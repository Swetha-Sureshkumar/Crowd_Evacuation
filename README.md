# Crowd_Evacuation
This is a computer-generated model that models the movement of people during an emergency evacuation. By forecasting
how people will act and how quickly they can leave the area, this simulation can
assess the success of the crowd evacuation system. The simulation often makes use
of information about the crowd’s age, physical capabilities, and knowledge of the
place, as well as information on the layout, size, and location of the area’s exits and
other resources.
